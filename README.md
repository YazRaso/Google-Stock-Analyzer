I have designed this app to construct meaningful visuals of Alphabet's stock in 2024, I got the dataset from Kaggle, I used Pandas to process and clean the data, Used plotly.js to make beautiful visuals and then used streamlit for the UI! the site can be found at: https://stock-analyze.streamlit.app
